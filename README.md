# Programming Paradigms - Assignment 3: Prolog and University Course Prereqs
University of Calgary

A Prolog Knowledge-Base system that includes facts and rules, allowing for queries to determine what the course prerequisites are for any given course, specifically within the Computer Science degree program at the University of Calgary.
